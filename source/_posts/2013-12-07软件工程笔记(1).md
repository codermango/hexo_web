### 1. Basic way to deal with complexity:

* **abstraction**: ignore non-essential details
* **decomposition**: break problem into sub-systems
* **hierarchy**: simple relationship between trunks

### 2. Characteristics of software to other products:

* softare is developed not manufactured
* does not ware out but difficult to maintenance
* most of them are customerized
* cost is not depend on volume of production

### 3. waterfall:

* clear milestone
* no looking back
* easy to check progress
* no change after current phase

### 4. v-model:

* makes explicit the dependency between development and verification

### 5. spiral:

* determine(objectives, alternatives, constrains)
* evaluate
* develop
* verify
* plan next phase
* no change within phase but ok between

### 6. UP

*	**horizontal dimension**: phases
	* *inception*: build case
	* *elaboration*: design and detail of case
	* *construction*: build
	* *transition*: beta relase
<p></p>
*	**vertical dimension**: disciplines and supporting 	activities
*	**phase**: each cycle consist of four phases
*	**iteration**: each phase is subdivided into 		iterations
*	**workflow**: cross functional(management, environment, 	assessment, development) and engineering(requirement, design, implementation, testing)


### 7. model driven architecture:

* models expressed in a well-defined notation. The building of system can be organized around a set of models.

### 8. inductive（归纳）:

* when a program is built on the basis of input-output pairs or examples of computations

### 9. deductive（推导）:

* which uses automatic deduction of a proof of solvability of a problem and derives a program from the proof

### 10. transformational（转化）: 

* where a program is derived stepwise from a specification by means of transformations
