### UML and OOP:

* **actor:** describe any entity that interacts with the system
* **class:** abstractions of the properties and behaviours of a set of objects
* **instance:** a reality of class
* **use case diagram:** describe behaviour from external view
* **extend:** represent exceptional or seldom invoked cases, point to the extended case, base case can exit alone
* **include:** behaviour that is shared across two or more use cases, point to the using case, base case cannot exit alone
* **class diagrams:** describe the static structure of the system
* **association:** 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many
* **aggregation:** empty diamond, consists of hierarchy, a special case of association

* **composition:** solid diamond, strong form of aggregation where components cannot exist without aggregate
* **inheritance:** empty triangle points to parents, eliminating redundancy
* **sequence diagram:** describe dynamic behaviour in terms of interactions
* **communication diagram:** alternative presentation of sequence diagram
	
	sequence diagram is good at expressing sequential logic, but communication diagram shows a larger view of an object at information exchanging.
* **state diagram:** describe the dynamic state of an individual object.(attribute change: active-inactive-closed)
* **activity diagram:** shows flow control within a system(a special case of state chart that its states are functions). function change: active-deactivate-close

***For physical implementation of system***

* **component diagrams:** show structure of components.
* **deployment diagrams:** used to model the hardware that will be used to implement the system.
* **organizational diagrams:** packaging and components.
